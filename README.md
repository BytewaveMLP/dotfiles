# dotfiles

## Description
A collection of the dotfiles I use.

## Installation and usage
Unfortunately, there is no easy way to install these. The `install.sh` script provided with this repository is simply for perosnal use, and should not be used on any normal install (unless you happen to have everything installed and/or know what all I use). If you want to use my collection of dotfiles, you'll have to manually edit htem to your liking.
